# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but the app has been ejected so build scripts etc. are all in the repo now.

## Environment variables

The app uses the `dotenv` package to provide access to environment variables.
Copy the example files into the correct place:

```
cp .env.example .env

cp .env.webcomponent.example .env.webcomponent
```

Variables for the web application need to go into the `.env` file.
Variables for the web component can be placed in `.env.webcomponent`.

## Private repo setup (.npmrc)

The app requires a Git token for access to private repos (currently limited to `design-system-react`).

- Generated a token here, it'll be prefixed with `ghp_`: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Add a line to the bottom of `~/.npmrc` (this is in addition to the one in the repo): `//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<github_token>`

This will then be mounted as a secret in docker, and used to authenticate against the package repo.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Testing

Automated unit tests can be run via the `yarn test` command. These unit tests are written using the JavaScript testing framework `Jest` and make use of the tools provided by the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/). Automated accessibility testing for components is available via the `jest-axe` library. This can be achieved using the `haveNoViolations` matcher provided by `jest-axe`, although this does not guarantee that the tested components have no accessibility issues.

Integration testing is carried out via `cypress` and can be run using the `yarn exec cypress run` commmand. Currently, there are basic `cypress` tests for the standalone editor site, the web component and Mission Zero-related functionality. These can be found in the `cypress/e2e` directory. Screenshots and videos related to the most recent `cypress` test run can be found in `cypress/screenshots` and `cypress/videos` respectively.

## Web Component

The repo includes the Editor Web Component which shares components with the editor application but has a separate build process.

### Embedding

The web component can be included in a page by using the `<editor-wc>` HTML element. It takes the following attributes

- `code`: A preset blob of code to show in the editor pane.
- `sense_hat_always_enabled`: Show the Astro Pi Sense HAT emulator on page load

### `yarn start:wc`

Runs the web component in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3011](http://localhost:3011) to view it in the browser.

**NB** You need to have the main `yarn start` process running too.

It is possible to add query strings to control how the web component is configured. Any HTML attribute can be set on the query string, including `class`, `style` etc.

For example, to load the page with the Sense Hat always showing, add [`?sense_hat_always_enabled` to the URL](http://localhost:3001?sense_hat_always_enabled)

### Styling

There are several mechanisms that can be utilised to style part or all of the web component. Due to the nature of the web component, styles can either be applied to the web component itself or to the page that contains the web component.

#### Styling internally

Internal styles can be utilised and shared between the standalone editor and the web component. These styles are passed to the web component via the `style` attribute as a string and can be found in [`WebComponentProject.js`](LearnerExperience/editor-ui/src/components/WebComponent/Project/WebComponentProject.js) which uses [`InternalStyles.scss`](./src/components/WebComponent/InternalStyles.scss) and [`ExternalStyles.scss`](./src/components/WebComponent/ExternalStyles.scss) to style the web component.

Internal styles can be utilised due to a `--scale-factor` being set on font size and spacing variables and an update to the base font size being set at the appropriate size i.e. in [WebComponent.scss](./src/components/WebComponent/WebComponent.scss). This enables the use of the existing font and spacing variables as well as the `em` unit, allowing the web component to utilise the same definitions as the standalone editor.

**NB** due to `rem` using the `font-size` from the root it is unable to be overwritten in the shadow root so it should be avoided. Wherever possible use the existing calculations with the `--scale-factor` or `em` (however beware of nested relative sizing).

#### Styling externally

Styles from the parent application can be passed to the web component in a few different ways:

- The web component utilises a shadow DOM, this creates a shadow root element in the DOM which is separate from the main DOM. It does however copy and create a new DOM tree from the main DOM with all styles applied to the root in the main DOM available in the shadow root.

- A class can be applied to the custom element `wc-editor` which allows the parent application to style the web component container. This can be done by using the `class` attribute on the custom element. **NB** This attribute is `class` **NOT** `className`.

- Other styles from the parent application will not be inherited by the web component. However, the web component can be styled by the parent application by using the `::part` pseudo-element selector. This allows the parent application to style the web component by targeting the web component's shadow DOM. For example, the following CSS will style the web component's `#root` element (due to the part attribute definition in [web-component.js](./src/web-component.js)):

```scss
::part(editor-root) {
  // allows variables to be passed into the shadow dom
  @include sauce-theme-primary-vars();
  @include sauce-theme-secondary-vars();
  // allows you to set custom variables inside the shadow dom
  --editor-primary-theme: var(--theme-primary);
  --editor-secondary-theme: var(--theme-secondary);
  // background: var(--theme-secondary); // variables can then be applied inside the shadow dom
  // enables the parent application to control the size of the web components root element
  display: block;
  flex: 1 1 auto;
  max-block-size: 100dvh;
}
```

#### Instructions Styling

Classes from the stringified HTML passed to the web component in the `instructions` attribute are being used to style the project steps in the instructions panel.

##### Task Block

Styles for the task block can be applied as follows:

```html
<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Task heading</h2>
<div class="c-project-task">{task content here}</div>
```

##### Callouts

There are three types of callout: tip, debugging and generic. The green tip callout is generated as follows:

```html
<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">
  <h3>{Tip title}</h3>
  {tip content here}
</div>
```

The red debugging callout is generated as follows:

```html
<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--debug">
  <h3>{Debugging title}</h3>
  {debugging content here}
</div>
```

The blue generic callout is the default if no modifier is specifed:

```html
<div class="c-project-callout">{callout content here}</div>
```

##### Output

This class renders a bordered `div` with monospaced text that resembles Python output. Other font styles and images are not yet supported.

```html
<div class="c-project-output">{output content}</div>
```

#### Code snippets

Python code snippets are styled and syntax-highlighted using the `language-python` class:

```html
<code class="language-python">print('hello world')</code>
```

## Deployment

Deployment is managed through Github actions. The UI is deployed to staging and production environments via an S3 bucket. This requires the following environment variables to be set

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Other variables that pertain to the app, rather than its deployment are set with defaults in the [build-and-deploy workflow](./.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml). These are also in `.env.example`.

### Review apps

Currently the build is deployed to both S3 and Heroku. The PR should get updated with the Heroku URL, and the web component demo is at `/web-component.html` on the Heroku review app domain.

### Release Process

A new release of `editor-ui` is created via following process:

1. Create a branch on Github for the release.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version number and date in the list of changes under `Unreleased`.
3. At the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md`, add a link for the new version and update the `Unreleased` link to point to the latest version`â€¦HEAD`.
4. Update the version number in `package.json` to the new version number.
5. Push these changes to the release branch on Github.
6. Create a PR on Github for the release branch and put the `CHANGELOG` diff for the new release in the description.
7. Get someone to approve the PR and then merge.
8. Within the releases tab, create a new tag with the version number of the new release with the target set to `main`.
9. Give the release the same name as the tag and paste the `CHANGELOG` diff in the description.
10. Set the release to be the latest release and publish.
11. Go to Cloudflare and under `Workers > KV` select `editor` and change the `production-ref` to `releases/<new_version_number>`.
12. Go to `editor.raspberrypi.org` to see the new changes on production... ðŸš€
